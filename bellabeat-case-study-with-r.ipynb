Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nAfter analyzing FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, I found some **insights that would help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy.**\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523395294292-1fbf0cd2435e?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=759&q=80)\n\n**Target audience**\n\nWomen who work full-time jobs (according to the hourly intensity data) and spend a lot of time at the computer/in a meeting/ focused on work they are doing (according to the sedentary time data).\n\nThese women do some light activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). Even though they need to improve their everyday activity to have health benefits. They might need some knowledge about developing healthy habits or motivation to keep going. \n\n* As there is no gender information about the participants, I assumed that all genders were presented and balanced in this data set. \n\n**The key message for the Bellabeat online campaign**\n\nThe Bellabeat app is not just another fitness activity app. \nIt’s a guide (a friend) who empowers women to balance full personal and professional life and healthy habits and routines by educating and motivating them through daily app recommendations. \n\n**Ideas for the Bellabeat app**\n\n1. Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits for according to the CDC research. They found that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. Bellabeat can encourage people to take at least 8 000 explaining the benefits for their health.\n\n2. If users want to lose weight, it’s probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.\n\n3. If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.\n\n4. Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - I suppose, that people go to a gym or for a walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.\n\n5. As an idea: if users want to improve their sleep, the Bellabeat app can recommend reducing sedentary time.\n\n\n**Thank you** for your interest to my Bellabeat Case Study!\n\nThis is my first project using R. I would appreciate any comments and recommendations for improvement!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
